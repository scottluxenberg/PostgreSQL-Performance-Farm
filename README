This postgres performance farm runs exactly the same as the build farm. The tests were inspired by Greg Smith's
pgbench tools.

NOTE: If you do not have a build-farm account, always keep make-perf set to an active variable
NOTE: WHENVER YOU RUN A PERFORMANCE TEST, RUN WITH --test, so not to spam the buildfarm server
NOTE: At this point, the farm only supports Postgres 9.0 due to the use of workers in PGBench,
later verisons should make it backwards compatable. So therefore, always run this with the default
branch (HEAD)
